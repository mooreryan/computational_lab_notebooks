# Examples & Tutorials

In this section, we will go over a couple of tutorials to help you get

## Cram tests

If you are feeling very brave, you can get always up-to-date examples
by looking at the cram tests in `<project root>/tests/cram`.  The
`*.t` files are cram tests.  They look a bit weird at first but the
walk through different scenarios of using the `cln` CLI app.  They are
guaranteed to be up to date with whatever version of the code you're
running since they are integration tests!
